The Warp Core is the most important block for
a warp ship.
To use a warp core, first wrap it as a computercraft
peripheral.

Then you can use these methods:
setBounds:
  Sets dimensions of region to be teleported, relative to faces of warp core block
  w.setBounds(xPlus, xMinus, yPlus, yMinus, zPlus, zMinus)
getBounds:
  Returns saved bounds
  w.xPlus, xMinus, yPlus, yMinus, zPlus, zMinus = w.getBounds()
setWarpVector:
  Sets relative coordinates to teleport to
  w.setWarpVector(x, y, z)
getWarpVector:
  Returns stored relative coordinates
  w.x, y, z = getWarpVector()
setDimension:
  Sets desired dimension ID to teleport to
  You can also call it with no arguments to set the desired dimension to the one the warp core is currently in
  w.setDimension(-1)
  w.setDimension()
getDimension:
  Returns stored desired dimension ID
  dim = w.getDimension()
getEnergy:
  Returns amount of energy currently stored in warp
  energy = w.getEnergy()
getMaxEnergy:
  Returns maximum amount of energy that warp core can store
  maxEnergy = w.getMaxEnergy()
warp:
  Activates warp core, trying to teleport to the currently stored dimension, then relative coordinates
  w.warp()
listMethods:
  Returns a string listing the methods that can be used with the warp core
  print( w.listMethods() )



There is also a debug mode if a computer is not available.
NOTE: the debug mode does not allow you to change bounds.
Also, you will still need power and a dimension address.

To use debug mode, first place a sign on top of the warp core.
On the first three lines, type the desired x, y, and z
relative coordinates.  On the last line, type the desired
dimension id.
If x, y, or z cannot be read, it will default to 0.
If the dimension cannot be read, it will default to
the warp core's current dimension.

Then, activate the warp core with a redstone signal.
