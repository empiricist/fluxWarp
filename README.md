fluxWarp
===========

DISCLAIMER: This mod is very alpha at the moment!  Also, I have almost no idea what I am doing.  

This is a mod for teleporting things, including structures and entities.

To use it, you will need ComputerCraft and a mod for generating and moving Redstone Flux, such as one or more of the following:
    -Thermal Expansion & Dynamics
    -EnderIO
    -Extra Utilities

There is some documentation available in-game on the Warp Info Disk.
