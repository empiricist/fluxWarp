Congratulations on your discovery of
Flux Warp Mechanics!  The Contact division
of the United Federation of Worlds would like to
send you this introductory information package to
help you do your warping safely and successfully!

In the docs/ folder is information on various
blocks and items that are helpful for warping.

In the main folder are some helpful programs for
you to use or modify to better suit your needs.

Credit to the authors of the "Warp Drive" mod,
whose control program was adapted to work with
the flux warp core.
