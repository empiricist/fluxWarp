The Dimension Address allows your warp core to
teleport to other dimensions.

WARNING: If you want to come back, you will also
need a dimension address for your original dimension!

To use it, go to the dimension you want to save
the address of, and right click with the blank address
in your hand.  You should see information about the
stored dimension in the item's tooltip.

If you want to clear the stored data from a
dimension address, just sneak + right click with
the address in your hand.

Then, place the dimension address in any standard
inventory (such as a chest) directly adjacent to the
warp core on any side.  If you have Extra Utilities
installed, a filing cabinet works quite well.

Now your warp core should be able to teleport to the
dimension you saved.

NOTE: Dimension addresses do NOT get used up
